## ANALYZING TRAFFIC SOURCES
### Business Concept: Traffic Source Analysis
Traffic source analysis is about understanding where your customers are coming from and which channels are driving the highest quality traffic.

### Common Use Cases : Traffic Source Analysis
- Analyzing search data and shifting budget towards the engines, campaigns or keywords driving the strongest conversion rates
- Comparing user behavior patterns across traffic sources to inform creative and messaging strategy
- Identifying opportunities to eliminate wasted spend or scale high-converting traffic
## TASK
**1. ðŸ“Œ FINDING TOP TRAFFIC SOURCES**

***Steps***:
- Breakdown of sessions by UTM source, campaign and referring domain
- Filter results up to sessions before '2012-04-12' and group results by utm_source, utm_campaign and http_referer
  
***Query***:

![site_traffic_breakdown](https://github.com/Shivani1279/Maven_Factory_MySql/assets/117190648/1f07d624-9e73-4abd-a96f-0c674b96a77a)

***Result***:

![answer_site_traffic_breakdown](https://github.com/Shivani1279/Maven_Factory_MySql/assets/117190648/1db75f5d-6050-478e-b7e9-d3a74ca75b40)


- Most sessions came from gsearch nonbrand campaign traffic.
  
**2. ðŸ“Œ TRAFFIC CONVERSION RATE**

***Steps***:

- Calculate CVR from session(COUNT) to order(COUNT). If CVR < 4% need to reduce bids, otherwise if CVR >= 4% can increase bids to drive more volume
- Filter sessions < '2012-04-12', utm_source = 'gsearch' and utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
  
***Query***:

![traffic_source_conversion_rate_2](https://github.com/Shivani1279/Maven_Factory_MySql/assets/117190648/090606cb-7e48-408e-9126-be0709c853f4)


***Result***:

![answer_traffic_source_conversion_2](https://github.com/Shivani1279/Maven_Factory_MySql/assets/117190648/b44dabb1-15d2-467e-9263-9ca34d77997a)

- The conversion rate is less than 4%, which is 2.88%, hence we have to reduce bids.

**ðŸ’¡ Business Concept: Bid Optimization**

Analyzing for bid optimization is about understanding the value of various segments of paid traffic, so that you can optimize your marketing budget.

**ðŸ’¡ Common Use Cases: Bid Optimization**

- Using conversion rate and revenue per click analyses to figure out how much you should spend per click to acquire customers
- Understanding how your website and products perform for various subsegments of traffic (i.e. mobile vs desktop) to optimize within channels
- Analyzing the impact that bid changes have on your ranking in the auctions, and the volume of customers driven to your site

**3. ðŸ“Œ TRAFFIC SOURCE TRENDING**

***Steps***:
Calculate trend and impact on sessions for gsearch nonbrand campaign after bidding down on Apr 15, 2021
Filter to < '2012-05-10', utm_source = 'gsearch', utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'

***Query***:

![gsearch_volume_trends_3](https://github.com/Shivani1279/Maven_Factory_MySql/assets/117190648/3f215d72-ce25-4992-bf6c-433ee837e32f)

- The sessions after 2021-04-15 have dropped. Continue to monitor session volume.
  
**4. ðŸ“Œ TRAFFIC SOURCE BID OPTIMIZATION**

***Steps***:
Calculate the conversion rate from session to order by device type

***Query***:

![gesearch_device_level_perf_4](https://github.com/Shivani1279/Maven_Factory_MySql/assets/117190648/36151a8d-e7dd-4eb8-a243-3095490fb974)

- Desktop bids were driving nearly 4% of the conversion rate, so we should transfer the paid traffic spent to the desktop channel instead.

**5. ðŸ“Œ TRAFFIC SOURCE SEGMENT TRENDING**

***Steps***:

Calculate (with pivot) weekly session trends for both desktop and mobile after bidding up on the desktop channel on 2012-05-19
Filter to between '2012-04-15' to '2012-06-19', utm_source = 'gsearch', utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'

***Query***:

![gsearch_device_level_trend_5](https://github.com/Shivani1279/Maven_Factory_MySql/assets/117190648/c94c1f52-a7bf-453b-9864-59969613857a)
